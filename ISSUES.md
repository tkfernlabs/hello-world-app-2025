# Issues and Improvements

## Issues Found During Testing

### Backend Issues
1. **No custom 404 handler** - Currently returns default Express HTML error page
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: Non-existent endpoints return HTML instead of JSON
   - Recommendation: Add custom 404 middleware that returns JSON

2. **No error logging** - Server doesn't log errors to file
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: No persistent error logs for debugging
   - Recommendation: Add logging middleware (e.g., morgan, winston)

3. **No request validation** - No input validation for future POST/PUT endpoints
   - Status: Minor (not applicable yet since only GET endpoints exist)
   - Impact: Will need validation when adding endpoints that accept data
   - Recommendation: Add validation middleware when implementing data endpoints

4. **No rate limiting** - API has no rate limiting
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: Potential for abuse
   - Recommendation: Add rate limiting middleware for production

5. **No process manager** - Server runs directly with npm, not using PM2 or similar
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: Server won't auto-restart if it crashes
   - Recommendation: Use PM2 or similar process manager for production

6. **No environment variable validation** - No check for required env vars
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: Currently not an issue as only PORT is used with default
   - Recommendation: Add env validation when more config is needed

7. **No graceful shutdown** - Server doesn't handle SIGTERM/SIGINT gracefully
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: May cause issues during deployment/restart
   - Recommendation: Add graceful shutdown handlers

## Verified Working Features âœ…
- All three endpoints (/, /api/hello, /health) responding correctly
- CORS headers present and working (access-control-allow-origin: *)
- CORS preflight (OPTIONS) requests working
- JSON responses properly formatted
- HTTP status codes correct (200 for success, 404 for not found)
- External access working via https://backend-morphvm-hc5yreuu.http.cloud.morph.so
- Server running stable (PID 17762)
- GitHub repository synchronized
- Response times acceptable (~0.04s)

## Critical Path Items
None - All required functionality for Step 1 (Backend) is working correctly.

## Notes
- Issues listed above are improvements for production readiness
- Current implementation is sufficient for a hello world demo application
- All core requirements met: backend exposed externally, endpoints working, code in GitHub
